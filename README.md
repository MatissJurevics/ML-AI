# Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Testing

This is where I create ml/dl models from scratch and test them out.

Current things I have done:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Single Perceptron
- OvR classifier using 10 perceptrons for MNIST dataset


## File Structure

**/models**: Contains all the models I have created
*mnist.py*: The script that trains an OvR classifier to classify the MNIST dataset
